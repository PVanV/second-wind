## **PLAYER RESPONSIBILITIES**
Players attending an event are responsible for supplying their own miniatures, cards, dice, measuring tools, tokens, rosters, and other game pieces that are required during play. 

### **Miniatures**
Each player must have the miniature for each character on their roster. Players are allowed to customize their miniatures as they like but must follow these guidelines:

1. The miniature must be made from a majority of Atomic Mass Games miniature parts from the *Crisis Protocol* miniatures line.
1. The miniature must be easily identifiable as the character it represents.
1. The size or pose of a customized miniature cannot interfere with game play.
1. Miniatures must always be attached to a modeled base that is the appropriate size and shape of the original miniature.

### **Cards**
A player must have all Character cards, Team Tactic cards, and Crisis cards included in their roster. Proxies of cards are allowed if approved by the EO.

### **Dice**
Players must use official *Crisis Protocol* dice. This includes the dice found in the Core Box, Dice Expansions, and/or promotional material distributed by Atomic Mass Games. Players may use replacement dice if approved by the EO.

### **Measuring Tools**
Players are required to bring their own set of measuring tools. This includes both range and movement tools. Players are never allowed to modify their measuring tools but may replace them. Players using substitutions should check with the EO before the event begins so the tools can be verified as being the correct size and shape. Players may not use measuring devices that do not have an equivalent tool supplied by Atomic Mass Games.

### **Tokens**
There are two types of tokens in *Crisis Protocol*:  **essential** and **nonessential**. Essential tokens are tokens placed on the game board to represent specific effects. These tokens have a specific size and are supplied with the characters or cards that require them. Nonessential tokens are usually placed on character cards and are used to track damage, power, or an effect. 

Players are never allowed to modify their essential tokens but may replace them. Players using substitutions should check with the EO before the event begins so the tokens can be verified as being the correct size and shape. Players may modify or replace nonessential tokens as long as the tokens used are clear and do not interfere with game play.

### **Roster**
A player must submit a roster to the EO before the event begins and may not change their roster once the event begins. A roster is built as described on page 9 of the *Crisis Protocol* Core Rules book, which can be found at [atomicmassgames.com/rules](http://www.atomicmassgames.com/rules). 

Additionally, there is a list of restricted cards that can be found at  atomicmassgames.com/rules. A player may include only 2 cards found on this list in their roster. 

### **Sportsmanship**
All players are expected to act in a civil way during the event. Disputes and disagreements will happen during games, but players should remain respectful of other players, EOs, and the space they are playing in. Should a dispute or an argument arise, the players should immediately call for a judge to help resolve the issue. 

*Crisis Protocol* is an open information game. Players can always request to see stat cards, Team Tactic cards, and Crisis cards that are in an opponent’s roster both before and during the game. Players should never attempt to obscure or mislead their opponent about any stats, cards, or superpowers they have available.

### **Missed Opportunities**
Players are expected to follow the game’s rules, remembering to perform actions and use card effects when indicated. It is each player’s responsibility to maintain a proper game state and to ensure that all mandatory abilities and game steps are acknowledged. If a player forgets to use an effect during the timing specified by that effect, they cannot retroactively use it without the consent of their opponent. Players are expected to refrain from intentionally distracting or rushing an opponent with the intent of forcing a missed opportunity.

### **Margin of Error**
Characters are sometimes moved accidentally or placed inexactly during the normal course of the game. This is acceptable within a reasonable margin. Players must not abuse this margin of error, however, and they must use the components included with the game to help them be as accurate as possible. If a player feels their opponent is abusing this margin of error or if they need to make a particularly difficult movement, they should call an event organizer for assistance before moving any miniatures.

### **Unsportsmanlike Conduct**
Players who do not behave in a civil and respectful way can be ejected from the event or issued a warning, at the discretion of a judge or the EO.

Examples of unsportsmanlike conduct include: 

- Treating other players, judges, EOs, or spectators disrespectfully.
- Intentionally attempting to mislead your opponent, a judge, or the EO.
- Intentionally disrupting the placement of miniatures, terrain, or tokens on the table.
- Quickly removing dice from the table before your opponent can verify your roll.

## **USE OF TIMING DEVICES**
### **Event Round Times**
Each event round of *Crisis Protocol* is a predetermined length, giving players a certain amount of time to complete their games. The EO should start the timer for an event round after most players have found their seats and begun to set up. If a game has not concluded when the time for an event round runs out, the player with the most victory points (VPs) is the winner. In the case of a tie, players will immediately score the table as if the round had ended. If it is still a tie at this point, it will be recorded as a draw.

This event will use a 100 minute round timer.

### **Chess Clocks**
Chess clocks will be used for Second Wind. Chess clocks should be set to 45 minutes per player. When a player’s clock runs out, they immediately lose the game regardless of current VPs.

At the start of the game, the clocks will remain paused until deployment and the first power phase is complete, at which point the priority player will start their clock and take their first turn.

Each player is responsible for their own time. A player has the right to pass the time to their opponent whenever the opponent is making an action or spending time thinking about a decision. For example, an opponent deciding on using or resolving a reactive superpower such as Tricks And Traps or Lifesaver would be an instance to flip the clock onto the opponents time. While an opponent simply rolling defence dice would be an instance where you would keep the time running on your own clock.

The clock may be paused at the players’ discretion to resolve rules queries or judge calls. Excessive pausing of the clock will be considered time wasting by the judges and may be penalised.

In order to ensure timing in tournament games is fair and reasonable, at the end of the round the clock is immediately paused for the entirety of the Cleanup Phase and the following Power Phase. If either player is taking an excessive amount of time to resolve any decisions or player effects, a judge should be called to help resolve the issue.

## **EVENT ORGANIZER RESPONSIBILITIES**
The Event Organizer, or EO, is the person, store, or event that is putting on the event. Much like players, the EO has a set of responsibilities for the event.

### **Tournament Length**
This event will run until a player has more Tournament Points than any other player at the end of a round, or the maximum number of pre-determined rounds has been played, whichever comes first.

Players score Tournament Points (TPs) based on the outcome of each game.

• A player scores 1 TP for a win.

• A player scores 0 TP for a loss.

### **Tiebreaks**
The tiebreak used will be strength of schedule:

### **Pairings (Swiss)**
Pairings for round 1 must be randomised by the EO. However, the EO may decide to adjust the pairings to ensure that Players from the same gaming group are not matched together. If this decision is taken it must only apply for the first round.

From Round 2 onwards, Players should be randomly paired against other Players that have the same number of Tournament Points to form a match. If there is an odd number of Players with the same Tournament Points, randomly select one Player from the next lowest Tournament Point bracket to be the pair up. EOs should avoid pairing the same Players together multiple times during a tournament where possible. 

In the case of an odd number of Players, one Player receives a bye each round. This Player receives 1 Tournament Point (a win). In the first round, the T.O. randomly determines which Player receives the bye. In subsequent rounds, the EO randomly selects a Player from those with the lowest Tournament Point totals. The EO must ensure that the same Player does not receive a bye more than once per event.

If a player decides to concede a game or otherwise must end a game early their opponent is considered to have won the round.
